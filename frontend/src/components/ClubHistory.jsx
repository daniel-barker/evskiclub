        Many of the members of this club may be wondering about the group of
        pictures recently placed on the clubhouse wall, why they are there and
        who the people are. They are pictures of members and events that took
        place during the early years of the Ellicottville Ski Club. These
        pictures have been scattered around various places, and the feeling of
        many of the older members of the club was that an attempt be made to
        collect them and hang them in the club before they disappear forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ellicottville Ski Club is probably the oldest, still active ski club
        in this area. It all began in 1935 when a group of people in
        Ellicottville decided skiing would be a lot more enjoyable if they had a
        method of being pulled up the hills and eliminate the walking. They made
        their plans and decided to install a rope tow on Fish Hill, which is
        about half way between Ellicottville and Little Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is interesting to note that this tow was in operation for the winter
        of 1935-1936. According to Ezra Bowen, then the ski editor of
        &#8220;Sports Illustrated&#8221; in his book, <em>American Skiing</em>,
        the first permanent ski lift in the United States was installed on
        Gilbert&#8217;s Hill in Woodstock, Vermont for use in the winter of
        1934-35. It also was a rope tow.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this information it is evident that Ellicottville was among the
        pioneers in this country who helped bring about the tremendous interest
        in downhill skiing. The people who were most responsible for this
        installation were:
      </p>
      <p>Bill Northrup Tim Stokes</p>
      <p>Don Brooks Zeke Slating</p>
      <p>
        In 1938, the people skiing in Ellicottville decided to form a ski club,
        and to no one&#8217;s surprise, it was called the Ellicottville Ski
        Club. The first meeting was held on 11/10/38 and the following were
        elected officers and directors:
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Northrup, President</p>
      <p>Isobel Northrup, Treasurer</p>
      <p>Lillian Russow, Secretary</p>
      <p>Directors: A. E. Fraser</p>
      <p>Dr. G. D. Stone</p>
      <p>Tim Stokes</p>
      <p>Irene Russow</p>
      <p>Clarence Slating (Zeke)</p>
      <p>
        One of the original requirements to be an officer or a director was that
        the person had to be a resident of Ellicottville, but soon skiers began
        to trickle in from out of town, and this requirement was soon by-passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fish Hill was used for a few years, but it was apparent it was the
        coldest and windiest hill in Western New York, and to make matters
        worse, it wasn&#8217;t much of a ski hill, either. In 1938, the members
        decided to find another hill that would be protected from the wind and
        be more of a challenge. They decided on Greer Hill. This hill is located
        in town and is directly across from the Catholic church.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1939 the hill was cleared. The word, &#8220;cleared,&#8221; is being
        used very loosely in this case. The following winter, skiing began on
        Greer. This location proved to be better protected from the elements
        than Fish, and to say it was more challenging, surpassed their fondest
        expectations. To put a beginning skier on top of the hill and tell him
        to &#8220;go for it,&#8221; would be similar to placing a beginning
        mountain climber on top of Mount Everest and giving him the same
        instructions. Many of the people who skied there for the first time will
        tell you it was the single most traumatic experience of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were two vastly different factors that contributed to the success
        and the tradition of the club. The first was Mrs. Weller, the owner of
        the Lincoln Hotel, now the Ellicottville Inn, in town. She had a
        beautiful and wonderful philosophy of how to run a hotel. All she asked
        was that people come to the hotel for their luncheons, dinners and
        meetings, and to enjoy themselves. The thought of making a profit never
        entered her head. Fortunately, as we found out later, money was one
        thing she did not need.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this situation more fantastic, she loved skiers. From Friday
        night until Sunday night, the only people she would give rooms to had to
        be skiers. As a consequence, all through the forties and most of the
        fifties, the Lincoln was the home of the ski club. Every weekend
        throughout the winter they would all gather at the hotel and spend the
        evening in the so-called &#8220;Drinking Room,&#8221; drinking beer,
        telling their latest harrowing experiences on Greer, telling stories and
        lies, and singing most of the night away. They were not scattered all
        over town, because everyone who skied was there, and it created a
        togetherness and fellowship that is still evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other factor was that one of the members ventured north into Canada,
        and came back to spread the gospel that there was a Valhalla on earth
        for skiers&#8211;the Laurentian Mountains, north of Montreal, and
        &#8220;God,&#8221; who took the name of Chink Walker, had his throne in
        a place called &#8220;The Pub,&#8221; in St. Sauveur.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, only a few made the trip, but soon it was like an act of
        faith. It was not only a vacation, it was a pilgrimage. The sights, the
        sounds, the people were so different that it was a new world. They skied
        on hill 69, 70 and 71 in St. Sauveur. Or they would take to the Maple
        Leaf Trail and stop at those &#8220;far away places with the strange
        sounding names,&#8221; such as Piedmont, Mont Rolland, St. Marguerite,
        Val Morin, Val David, St. Agathe-Des Monts, St. Adele, and many others.
        They had a favorite pub in each of the towns. At noon they would have
        their favorite lunch of a couple of quarts of Molson&#8217;s, and
        sometimes, some of them were known to eat, though this was not the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no matter where they were, at night it was back to The Pub. There,
        vast quantities of Molson&#8217;s would vanish. Sometimes it was used to
        wash down the delicious French pastries that were served, but most of
        the time it was used medicinally to lubricate their throats as
        &#8220;God&#8221; lead them in song. A great number of the songs that we
        used to sing well, but that now we just mumble and forget the words,
        originated there. This continued until the time came when so-called
        progress in the Laurentians got to the point that it was now evident
        that Ellicottville was more like a town in the Laurentians than St.
        Sauveur had been.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, there were a few deficiencies on Greer that needed
        correcting. The first and most pressing was the rope tow. To say the
        original installation smacked of &#8220;Rube Goldberg&#8221; would be
        putting it mildly. The pulleys that supported the rope were the front
        wheels from old Chevrolets. They were mounted on trees and were anywhere
        from 20&#8242; to 30&#8242; off the ground and were just a tad out of
        line. As a result the rope had a nasty habit, either when skiing was the
        best, or when the temperature was 0 degrees or below, to either come off
        the pulley or to break. Anyone who has not experienced the pleasure of
        shinning up a thirty foot tree to replace a rope, or help make a
        25&#8242; long transmission splice in a rope, with the temperature 0
        degrees or below (sometimes at night) doesn&#8217;t know one of the real
        thrills of skiing in the &#8220;Good Old Days.&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1947 the members decided the thrill was gone in maintaining the old
        tow and the entire contraption should be replaced. At the same time it
        was decided that the shelter we had was inadequate as well. There was
        some objection to this, but stronger heads prevailed and decided that a
        building approximately 15&#8242; square, that housed a 100 H.P. motor, a
        6&#8242; flywheel, a 100 H.P. starter, a pot-belly stove and about 30
        half frozen skiers, truly was inadequate and should be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, whatever the ski club decided to do, the members did it.
        All the maintenance, clearing the hill in the fall, and new construction
        was a part of the privilege of being a member. That fall was the busiest
        in the history of the club. The steel was ordered along with the
        concrete for the footings for the poles and the lumber for the new
        shelter. All this material was carried up the hill by the members and
        erected by them. If at that time some misguided fool had suggested to a
        member that he knew of a book that outlined a series of exercises to get
        in shape for skiing, he would have been strangled on the spot, and any
        court in the country, after being informed of the facts, would bring in
        a verdict of justifiable homicide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work was completed in time for the ski season and the results were a
        shelter that all of the members, still half frozen, could use at the
        same time. The rope still fell off the pulleys and broke, but now it
        happened in a more sophisticated and scientific manner. With the new
        &#8220;improvements&#8221; we happily skied, drank Molson&#8217;s and
        sang our way through the late forties and early fifties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem of maintaining the hill resulted in the necessity for having
        the spring party. Each year the rope had to be removed from the hill and
        stored for the summer. This rope was no toy balloon, either. To make
        sure there were enough able-bodied hands, great effort was made to have
        a party that would be the best of the year. It became a must on every
        member&#8217;s calendar. Some of the parties were real barn burners.
        Unfortunately, with the passing of necessity to remove the rope, the
        necessity of the spring party was also removed, and one of the high
        spots of our ski season fell by the wayside.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early spring, when Greer was no longer skiable, the members would
        use the tow to take them to the top of the hill and ski cross country
        along the top of the ridge over to the fire tower and then down what is
        now called Mardi Gras, into town. It was noticed that the valley between
        Greer and the fire tower held snow longer, and more of it, than any
        other valley in the area. This information was stored away for future
        consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the late fifties, things began to change rapidly. In 1955 Mrs. Weller
        died, the hotel was sold, and we were no longer welcome there. At the
        same time up on Greer, members were finding they had fairly well
        mastered the hill as far as skiing was concerned, but the rope tow was
        beginning to master their aging arms. The members began looking at the
        valley on the other side of Greer and playing with the idea of a ski
        resort in that valley. In 1957 several members formed a corporation and
        began the development of what is now Holiday Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Valley rapidly developed, it presented a new dilemma for the ski
        club. An attempt was made to continue using Greer, but as members saw
        what was developing in the valley -T-bar lifts, groomed hills,
        restaurants and <span className="roif">rest rooms</span> they began to
        abandon Greer and move over to the Valley. As the Valley progressed
        along with the influx of new skiers into the town, there was no longer a
        place for the members of the ski club to get together.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, one of the members of the club, Dutch Roy, opened a ski
        lodge, and in the back of his property was an abandoned barn that he
        allowed us to use for our parties and meetings. In 1958 began the era of
        Dutch&#8217;s barn. Once again the members had a place to meet on
        Saturday night. The days of drinking Molson&#8217;s was gone, and in its
        place came Martinis and Manhattans, but once again we had a place where
        we could drink, tell our stories and lies and sing ourselves hoarse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a great time for a couple of years and had one distinction that
        was unique. We are without doubt the only ski club anywhere which can
        boast that they entertained several of the original astronauts in a
        dilapidated barn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again a problem arose. We were using the facilities of the lodge
        and putting a severe strain on its operation and the friendship of the
        owner. In 1960 at a summer party at Yacht Harbor, it was decided to
        build a club house in Holiday Valley. It was decided this should be
        accomplished for $15,000 or less. This figure was{" "}
        <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>slightly</span> low and
        explains why the club is still paying off bonds that had to be sold to
        take care of this minor miscalculation. However, on New Year&#8217;s Eve
        of 1960, the first party was held in our new club house. As we had
        signed a ten-year lease with the valley, and with an option to buy, we
        had eliminated the problem of holding the club members together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The building of the club house was the bridge between the old ski club
        and the new. As the club flourished through the years, it became
        necessary in 1965 to expand and another room was added. The club has
        remained over the years, vital and progressive, as can be testified by
        the fact that there is discussion at the present time of the need for
        future expansion. We are looking forward to 1988 when we will celebrate
        our Golden Anniversary.

        The first expansion of the Clubhouse was voted on in 1968. The south
        wall was extended out its entire length, giving the members much more
        room with the addition of tables and chairs and an indoor grill. Prior
        to the addition, the only gathering place was around the fireplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years after the expansion, Holiday Valley decided to put in a new
        chair lift … and guess where? Yes, just east of the Club. We now had
        ski-out and ski-in access to the slopes. The chair lift and trail below
        it was called the “Chute”. We could not have planned it better, had we
        been involved in the decision!
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership remained strong through the 70s and 80s. Applicants were put
        on a “waiting list”, and that applicant list procedure continues today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holiday Valley continued to expand and improve during this time, as did
        the entire surrounding communities. Wow!!
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1983, another move to expand the Club’s facilities was underway. This
        renovation was to the east, facing the Chute Chair. A positive vote was
        held and a bond issue sold, and with the financing in place,
        construction was completed for the 1984-1985 season. This expansion
        included the lower level and main floor, offering plenty of room for ski
        and boot storage, as well as additional seating and table space on the
        main floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decade saw the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Ellicottville Ski
        Club. A gala event was arranged and fully attended in the winter of
        1988. A packed house with formal attire made for a wonderful evening.
        What a night, with skits and all, emceed by Jim Ramsey, with Cupie Cox
        leading us in a favorite song, “They Never Mention Aunt Clara”.
      </p>
      <p>
        This event also served as an opportunity for the Social Committee to
        re-think the Saturday night parties, which was a long-standing
        tradition. A formal Presidents’ Ball was added as annual event, honoring
        all past presidents of ESC. The “Sing-A-Long” was also included as the
        Season Opener for the social events, to keep that tradition intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of social events, the “Titanic” themed event in February of
        1999 was arguably the best Club social event ever held. A sold-out crowd
        had members signing up for either “First Class” or ”Steerage” tickets,
        with dress appropriate for your class of service. The menu was also
        “class of service” inspired, with beef tenderloin for those in First
        Class and Irish stew in Steerage! A 24-foot replica of the port side of
        the Titanic ship covered the south wall of the Club. A 4-foot Titantic
        cake was designed, baked, and decorated by Charlotte Burnham, which took
        16 boxes of cake mix to create. A violinist set the mood in the first
        class section, while Irish jigs were played in Steerage. The entire
        facility was festooned with complementary décor. Congratulations to the
        committee, headed by Barbara Graham and Mabel Grainger, and many
        volunteers, for that one!
      </p>
      <p>
        The last decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and the first of the 21
        <sup>st</sup>, proved to be fairly active for the Club. The annual Mardi
        Gras weekend in early March in Ellicottville continued to be a big hit.
        There were two particular events that attracted the Club’s involvement,
        with the first being the Saturday night parade in the village. The
        second was the Dummy Downhill, held on the lower portion of the Yodeler
        slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Club entered the parade seven times, garnering 1<sup>st</sup> place
        6 times, and 2<sup>nd</sup> place once. Each year, Bob Truckenbrod would
        do an artist’s rendering of our float entry, and also produced and
        directed the entire undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>The winning floats were:</p>
      <p>
        Alice in Wonderland (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        101 Dalmatians (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vikings (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry Potter (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        Grateful Dead (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        Titanic (1<sup>st</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lion King (2<sup>nd</sup> Place)
      </p>
      <p>
        Our thanks for the float entries went out to all who helped build the
        floats and to John Northrup for the use of one of his trucks each year.
        Many thanks to Mike Hess, who had the float’s artist renderings matted
        and framed, and then donated them to the Club, where they are
        permanently on display.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dummy Downhill was something else! Entrants would design an
        artificial skier and release it down the lower portion of Yodeler. A
        jump or two along the way would test the dummy’s design and aerodynamic
        characteristics. Over time, we tested our membership’s design abilities
        … with little luck. Finally, one year Jim Blanchard put together a
        winner, deemed by crowd applause. Our entry was named “Miss Ellie
        Cottville.” Nice going, Jim!
      </p>
      <p>
        We got through Y2K unscathed, with another memorable event to celebrate
        the year 2000. A new century was upon us. The spring of that year saw
        the bulldozing of the Middle Chalet, the first lodge built at Holiday
        Valley during the 1957-58 season. The old chalet was replaced with a
        world-class facility, to be called Yodeler Lodge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be outdone, at the General meeting of the ESC in 2005 the members
        voted on a major reconstruction of the Clubhouse to be completed in the
        Fall of 2006. Bonds were sold for a total amount of $300,000 to finance
        the project. The old Clubhouse building was gutted, and the north side
        was bumped out about 6 feet on both levels. A permanent bar, built by
        Kevin McKnight, was installed and the kitchen was replaced and
        reconfigured to better serve the membership, featuring 2 double wall
        ovens and 2 separate sink areas, as well as a large serving counter …
        lots of room for the “worker bees” plus all members and guests. Another
        gala social event celebrated the opening of this completely renovated
        facility in the fall of 2006.

        Around this same time a few ladies of the Club came up with their own
        version of a Ladies’ Day event that had been held at Holimont. In 2005,
        a small group of lady skiers gathered for a fun Friday of skiing, with
        lunch following at Holiday Valley. What started as a small group of ESC
        women enjoying a day of skiing together turned into an annual event,
        with nearly 50 lady skiers and about 100 lady members, spouses, and
        guests attending an evening charity dinner and auction. As of 2019, the
        ladies of ESC have raised nearly $90,000 for local charities! Helmets
        off to some of the early founders and Chairs of the event – Laura
        DeCinque, Holmes McGuigan-Webb, Debra Fierle, Lisa Colby, and Erin
        Fierle. In 2020 new chairs Susie Robbins and Diana Renaldo will step in,
        and who will make this special event their very own. And always many
        thanks to all the ladies who pitch in each year for this great ESC event
        that also benefits the community we ski in!

        In 2010, past-president Bill Hansen graciously presented a gift to the
        Club, referred to as “The Last Call Bell”, which would serve two
        purposes. Situated over the back of the bar, the bell is rung during
        social events to signify that the event is concluding. In addition, the
        bell would go on to have a more solemn purpose. Going forward, at each
        General Meeting, the names of our members who departed the prior year
        are read, and one stroke of the bell is sounded, for each deceased
        member, representing a tribute and fond farewell to those members.

        Also in 2010, Holiday Valley held a contest to name the Holiday Valley
        Ski Queen during the annual Mardi Gras festivities. ESC was fortunate to
        claim the title 3 years in a row! By crowd applause, Holmes
        McGuigan-Webb was crowned Carnival Ski Queen in 2010, Maria Ponikvar in
        2011, and Alicia Robinson Long in 2012. Congratulations ladies and thank
        you for doing ESC proud!

        The next decade found the membership enjoying their newly renovated
        facility. Fast approaching was the year 2013, representing the 75
        <sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the ski Club. Research was done by yours
        truly to see how we ranked in terms of the Club’s standing as one of the
        oldest ski clubs in America. We are arguably the oldest chartered
        incorporated continuously active ski club in the United States!
      </p>

        Now on to 2013. Sheri Barrera chaired the special event, along with a
        rather large group of volunteers. It was held on November 10, 2013,
        seventy-five years to the day when the when the Club was founded. The
        minutes of the first meeting of ESC were read by yours truly, and the
        remainder of the day was enjoyed by all in attendance, including
        children, reminiscing the past and anticipating the future. During the
        event, the song “Edelweiss” was adopted as the Ski Club’s official song.

        At the 2018 General meeting, it was announced that a gift to the Club
        was received from the estate of Mary Ellen and Don Morrison, who had
        been members of the Club since 1959. The Morrison’s cash gift was to be
        used for an appropriate purpose, and after polling the general
        membership the project selected was an outdoor fire pit, on a new
        concrete pad and complete with seating, just west of the Clubhouse and
        facing the Edelweiss slope. How appropriate, as the Morrisons loved
        sitting around the indoor fireplace with fellow members after skiing.
        Thank you to the Morrisons. We know how much you both enjoyed and loved
        the Ellicottville Ski Club.

        At the 2018 Annual Meeting, we recognized our longest-tenured member,
        Edna Northrup, whose husband Wilbur “Doc” Northrup was an original
        founding member of ESC and it’s first president. Edna has been a member
        of the Club for 70 years!

        Let us remember that in addition to being a social club, ESC is also a
        ski club!! With that in mind, below is a list of members’ children who
        went on to high levels of ski competition (more will be added as we get
        their details):

        As I write this brief history (Part II) I checked the calendar … it was
        80 years ago today, 11/10/1938, that the Ellicottville Ski Club was
        founded. What a treasure we have!
      </p>
      <p>
        p.s. And on a personal note, there may be an embellishment or two in the
        above recall of our club’s history from 1968. My apologies!
      </p>
      <p>With pleasure, I submit these memories,</p>
      <p>Korky Kantowski</p>
